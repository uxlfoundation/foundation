UXL Foundation: List of Suggested Projects for the UXL Foundation in GSOC 2025
==============================================================================

The UXL Foundation governs a set of predominantly C++ projects that aim to bring vendor neutrality to HPC and AI software development using CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators.
These projects are based on the oneAPI specification and open source software and cover a range of domains from AI, Math, ISO Parallel C++ and multi-node GPU systems.

Our overall goal is to build a multi-architecture multi-vendor software ecosystem for all accelerators, 
unify the heterogeneous compute ecosystem around open standards and build on and expand open-source projects for accelerated computing.

This page contains proposed projects for GSOC 2025 have been provided by different UXL Foundation projects.
Note that all the projects are likely to require a good working knowledge of C++, including features like templates and lamdas.
You can join our Slack workspace and channels to discuss any of these ideas, or your own ideas if you have other projects you would like to submit.
Each project under the UXL Foundation has their own Slack channel.

`oneMath`_
==========

The oneMath project is a library that develops a standards based API for a range of math operators so that developers can call the 
same API and target multiple CPUs and GPUs from different vendors. For GSOC there are opportunities to implement new functionality for the oneMath project 
to enable the library to support new operators and backends for different processor architectures.

Potential mentors for the projects are maintainers of the oneMath project including Romain Biessy and Maria Kraynyuk.

The following are projects that have been proposed by oneMath.

Implement New Math Operators for different CPU and GPU targets
--------------------------------------------------------------

**Random Number Generation (RNG)**

The oneMath specification defines some math operators that are not yet implemented in the open source project.
These are all variations on random number generation using different algorithms and techniques.

- The RNG SOBOL implementation, defined as oneapi::math::rng::sobol in the oneAPI specification
- The RNG mt19937 implementation, defined as oneapi::math::rng::mt19937 in the oneAPI specification
- The RNG mcg59 implementation, defined as oneapi::math::rng::mcg59 in the oneAPI specification
- The RNG mt2203 implementation, defined as oneapi::math::rng::mt2203 in the oneAPI specification
- The RNG uniform bits implementation, defined as oneapi::math::rng::uniform_bits in the oneAPI specification

These can be implemented as part of the Google Summer of Code for Intel, Nvidia and AMD processors using the relevant library, from Intel oneMKL and cuRAND.
The development work will require implementing the bindings for these RNG routines for the chosen target(s) and implementing tests that can be used for the new implementations.
We expect each implementation might take 90-175 hours but this depends since the learnings from integrating the first operator can be taken into the others.

Add open source backends for LAPACK and DFT
-------------------------------------------

**LAPACK**
oneMath has been adding open source implementations for the different math domains it supports and we would like to see another added for LAPACK for x86 and aarch CPUs.
The project would be to add an open-source CPU backend to the LAPACK domain for the oneMath project, the Netlib LAPACK project is a good candidate for this.
There is existing `BLAS integration with Netlib`_ that can be used for reference, this shows the integration and bindings implemented for BLAS.
This project is expected to take 90 hours, and requires tests to also be implemented for this new target and backend.

**DFT**
oneMath has been adding open source implementations for the different math domains it supports and we would like to see another added for DFT for x86 and aarch CPUs.
The project would be to add an open-source CPU backend to the DFT domain for oneMath, and the `FFTW`_ project is a good candidate for this.
This project is expected to take 90 hours, and requires tests to also be implemented for this new target and backend.

`oneDAL`_
=========

oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a powerful machine learning library that helps you accelerate 
big data analysis at all stages: preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and decision making.

Potential mentors for the projects include oneDAL maintainers Ian Faust and Sergey Yakovlev.

The project has produced their own list of ideas on `the oneDAL GitHub`_.

`oneCCL`_
=========

The following project is being proposed by the oneCCL project.
oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) provides an efficient implementation 
of communication patterns used in deep learning on multi-node archtiectures such as research 
clusters.

Potential mentor for the projects is oneCCL maintainer Maria Garzaran and other engineers from the project will be available.

**Arm, Nvidia and AMD Architectures**

oneCCL can currently be used with x86 based architectures with Intel GPUS to load balance work across multiple nodes and is used with the Argonne Aurora supercomputer.
For example, it can be used to optimize `execution of PyTorch`_.
The project would like to support AMD, Arm and Nvidia processors. These targets could be individual projects.
The APIs provided by oneCCL and defined in the oneAPI specification are generic and could be mapped to the relevant calls for the target architecture.
We would expect each individual additional architecture to take 90 hours of work.
