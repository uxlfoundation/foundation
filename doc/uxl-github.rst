UXL use of GitHub
=================

This document describes the use of GitHub for the UXL project.

uxlfoundation org
=================

The UXL project is hosted on GitHub under the `uxlfoundation`_ organization. It
contains repos that are not specific to any one open source project. There will
be a small set of ``owners`` for the org. ``@thelinuxfoundation`` is an owner
as backup in case UXL owners are not available.

Giving Access to Resources
--------------------------

Try to use GitHub Teams that are defined by roles. For example,
``@oneapi-spec-maintainers`` are the maintainers for the oneapi spec and have
write access. Using a team-based role instead of directly adding maintainers to
the repo makes it possible to ``@tag`` the team in issues and PRs.

If a role specific team is overkill, but you still want to be able to ``@tag``
someone in a repo in uxlfoundation org, they can be added to the `UXL Members`_
team. If you have a role in UXL (e.g. SIG leader), you can be added as a
maintainer of this team.

GitHub Actions
==============

UXL Foundation projects make use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration
and testing.

Available Runners
-----------------

In addition to the `Standard GitHub-hosted runners`_ the UXL Foundation GitHub
organization has several member-hosted test systems available for use:
