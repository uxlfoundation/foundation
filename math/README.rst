=======================
UXL Foundation Math SIG
=======================

The Math SIG hosts discussions and presentations for fundamental
mathematical routines for use in high-performance computing,
engineering, financial and other applications. Functionality
that is covered may include dense linear algebra, sparse linear
algebra, discrete Fourier transforms, random number generators,
summary statistics and vector math. In addition to
domain-specific functionality, the Math SIG may also discuss
overall design features like the execution model, memory model,
or error handling.

The Math SIG is led by Sarah Knepper (Intel).
