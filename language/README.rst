===========================
UXL Foundation Language SIG
===========================

The Language SIG hosts discussions and presentations focused on
how to integrate a broad range of languages to support oneAPI.
The languages at the heart of oneAPI are C++ and SYCL. This
group discusses how work done within the oneAPI open source
implementations can contribute to the ISO C++ and SYCL
specifications managed by ISO and Khronos respectively.
The SIG does not discuss the design of SYCL APIs, just general feedback.

The language SIG is led by Biagio Cosenza <bcosenza AT unisa DOT it>. 


2026 Language SIG Quarterly Meetings
------------------------------------

The Language SIG currently organizes its activities through quarterly meetings.
Depending on the needs, additional meetings may be scheduled to discuss specific topics.
The Language SIG Chair is responsible for organizing the meetings.
