Rod reported on the proposal to hold a fully online oneAPI DevSummit to showcase, assess and foster engagement, and create success stories on the Foundation’s work. Support from all SC members would be necessary and efforts would need to be driven by UXL Foundation members, who would participate as speakers, and who would be strongly encouraged to reach out to all their ecosystems and audiences, and channels to generate success. All were in favor and agreed to proceed with the event. Melissa will check on the potential costs of having a separate UXL track at other events, e.g., at the LF AI Summit.
The Steering Committee agreed to proceed with the plan for the DevSummits.

The call for presentations at a PyTorch conference in September is due next week. Members described their onsite presence and discussed possible ways to integrate UXL into their conference activities. Alison suggested that attending Members highlight their company’s UXL Foundation membership in their respective marketing materials, collateral, and talks. It was agreed to submit a talk on the UXL vision and a poster. 

There is an issue regarding the lack of public build infrastructure that would facilitate and encourage contributions. Potential fixes were discussed. 

Rod talked about last week’s presentations from Arti Gupta and Sri Ramkrishna, in particular, about the broader community plan towards education and awareness of oneAPI, and the existing materials that are available for developers. Rod will distribute his slides along with the meeting notes and will revisit with Aarti and Sri to address the questions raised during the discussion.
