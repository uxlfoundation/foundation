Marketing Materials Budget
--------------------------

There was not enough members present to make approval for the budget. 
Rod will follow up offline.

Foundation Goals and Metrics
----------------------------

The goals and metrics were shown and the group agreed these are good to be 
published with the addition of a measure of maintainer representation from 
across organisations.

A comment was made that a future objective could be increasing the 
contributions from different organisations and individuals to the point 
where <50% are from a single organisation. Agreed to re-visit this later.

Bringing new projects to UXL Foundation
---------------------------------------

Dave Murray raised the discussion of some projects that could be a good 
fit for inclusion in the foundation. The group talked through a few 
examples of projects. 

The conclusions were:

* Criteria for inclusion would be useful for assessment of options
* Other foundations have lifecycles for projects, we should implement 
  something lightweight
  * All projects should be assessed annually for viability within the foundation
* We agreed that projects should fill a key strategic gap and have the potential 
  to increase membership and collaboration within the foundation

Agenda for next meeting
-----------------------

* Run through the projects audit based on Red Hat's health checklist for open source projects
* Update on the ongoing oneDAL contribution work
* Discuss progress of Working Groups
