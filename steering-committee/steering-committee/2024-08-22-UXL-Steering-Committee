- Rod introduced Colin Davidson, Pietro Ghiglio, and Uwe Dolinsky, who were attending to present on the oneAPI construction kit, an open source toolkit for implementing heterogeneous programming models. There was discussion around the benefits of the software, and why it’s important to include it to the core. There will be a follow on discussion with the SC regarding support for the oneAPI construction kit. 

- Rod reported that there is a pull request for the charter that is up for review. Rod will recirculate it to the SC.

- The call for papers for the Oct 9-10 DevSummit has been issued, with a deadline of 30 August. SC members were encouraged to submit if they haven’t yet done so.

- The All General Meeting has been tentatively scheduled for late October, close to UXL Foundation’s anniversary. SC members were requested to check their calendars for their availability. As well, the SC was requested to think about what we’d want to present, and what is the call for action from membership. Melissa will reissue the 1 yr anniversary survey which is intended to get feedback from membership on how the Foundation can better serve them moving forward.

- Rod reminded members that the billing period for UXL Steering Members is coming up, and the 2025 billing cycle will start on the 1st of January.
