UXL Strategy and Architecture
-----------------------------

Rod Burns presented some materials to help the groups put together a 
strategy for the UXL Foundation that can be published and used to 
guide the members towards a common set of goals.

First step was agreeing the Strategy Intent, Aspirations and Desired 
Outcome. 

"Recognising the increasing importance of GPUs and other accelrators,
where most software is currently proprietary, the UXL Foundation 
desires to build the largest open ecosystem for accelerator computing 
in order to enable developers to write code for all vendors."
  
Following this the group talked about stakeholders and how they 
fit into the foundation community. 

The key identified stakeholders:

* Processor Vendors
* HPC Library and App Developers
* AI Library and App Developers
* AI Framework Developers
* Cloud Service Providers
* Linux Distribution Organisations
* Community Developers

There was good discussion on how to evolve the content and position 
the strategy. Separate sessions will be set up to obtain individual 
input and feedback.
