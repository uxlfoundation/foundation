Press Activity
--------------

The group discussed the recent articles that reference the UXL 
Foundation from Reuters and others. The journalist talked to members 
back in October and did not share the article ahead of time. The 
articles don't fully reflect the goal of the foundation, that 
being to build an inclusive and open ecosystem for all processors. 
It also contained some inaccuracies, that the projects can already 
target Nvidia GPUs for example.

The outcome of discussions were to use the webinar to educate people 
about the objectives of the foundation, and also to request a review 
of articles in the future.

An action was taken to find out who are authorised to be spokespeople 
for our Steering Committee organisations.

Webinar Planning
----------------

The group discussed the best format for the webinar on 30th April and 
how they will contribute. The schedule will be shared. We have one 
more Steering Committee meeting before the webinar.


UXL Strategy and Architecture
-----------------------------

Following Andrew Richards' presentation to the group the group 
discussed what should be the output and next steps.

It was agreed that we didn't get a full chance to discuss all the 
details of the presentation, but that the organisation does need to 
form a strategy and high level roadmap for the UXL Foundation.

Some members are keen to figure out how the UXL Foundation fits in 
with the AI software frameworks. The frameworks currently tend to use 
different backends for different processors. How can oneDNN and oneMKL 
in particular be used to enable frameworks to target multiple 
different processors through a unified API?

It seems like oneDNN can be used to enable new targets, like the Arm 
CPU target that has been added. It was suggested that a Work Package  
could be formed to investigate this. The topic can be brought to the 
Open Source Working Group.

Action taken to organise a series of strategy sessions to define this 
for the UXL Foundation for publication.
Action for Rod to bring together an initial proposal for this based on 
Andrew's content and other feedback and input so far.
