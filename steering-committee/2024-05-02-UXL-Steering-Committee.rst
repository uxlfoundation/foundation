Updates
-------

The webinar last week was a success with nearly 80 live attendees 
and 179 registered. There were a lot of good questions.

The group agreed we could use the questions asked to create some 
FAQ type material for the website, and also a getting started 
type of guide. Issues have been made in the tracker for these.

General
-------

The Steering Committee were joined by members of an existing open 
source to discuss potential areas for collaboration and even 
inclusion within the UXL Foundation. Further discussion will be 
held between both the project maintainers and also the Steering 
Committee to agree next steps.
