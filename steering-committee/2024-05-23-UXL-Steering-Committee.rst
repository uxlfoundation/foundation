Notes:

Rod reported on attendance of the ISC conference last week. He had many meetings with existing and potential members of the foundation and expects multiple new members from these conversations. He also met with the High Performance Software Foundation leaders who announced the formation at ISC and held a Birds of a Feather session. They are keen to collaborate with us since there are clear connections between the projects. There was a keynote presentation from Codeplay CEO Andrew Richards where there were walk ons from Rod alongside Argonne and Samsung talking about open standards and the UXL Foundation.

At the same time Ragesh from Fujitsu presented their contributions to the oneDAL project at Linarocon.

Melissa Aranzamendez has joined the Linux Foundation and acting as Program Manager for the UXL Foundation, we welcome her to this role and the team.

There are three new members since the last Steering Committee meeting - Inspire Semiconductors, UntetherAI and Code Reckons.

There have been nearly 400 views of the UXL Foundation webinar hosted by the Linux Foundation.

Sri and Arti joined the meeting to present a proposal to hold two DevSummit events hosted by the UXL Foundation.

The actions from this discussion were as follows:

* Rod: Follow up with Steering Committee members to reach agreement on proceeding with the DevSummits plan
* Rod: Follow up with Sri and Arti to gather information for budgets and effort for the additional community plans
