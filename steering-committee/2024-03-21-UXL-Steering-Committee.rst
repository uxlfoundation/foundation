UXL as a Platform Presentation
------------------------------

Andrew Richards continued his presentation to the group on his thoughts 
for the UXL Foundation projects. This will be published as a written 
piece as well. The details of this will be available soon.

There were discussions and questions, one output is for the foundation 
to work on use cases and cast studies of architectures and apps using 
the UXL Foundation projects to help people understand more about why 
they should be using them. This is both from a hardware and a software 
perspective.
Another is that a form of conformance or compatibility is an area that 
needs to be explored for the projects, since adoption will depend on 
the projects being compatible across vendor targets.
