General
-------
Working Groups have kicked off and had their first meetings. There 
will be monthly meetings from now.
Slack channels are now available for most groups and there is some 
activity on there. Working Groups will use this to coordinate outside 
of the meetings.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

At the previous meeting we briefly discussed whether the foundation 
should participate in the Google Summer of Code initiative.
Penporn took an action to find out more about this and whether it 
could be suitable.

The findings were positive, it is not only large or very established 
projects that are chosen and the work for participants can be small 
or large. The key thing is that a mentor is needed for the person 
who might participate on the work.

The group agreed we should apply to be part of the program, and that 
it would be beneficial to also reach out to existing groups such as 
the Centres of Excellence for oneAPI to help find suitable 
participants and mentors. We will also need to check the legal terms.

Action: Rod to pursue an application to Google Summer of Code.

Autosar Demonstration
---------------------

There is a thread on the general Slack channel about the potential 
creation of a demonstration that uses UXL projects and SYCL with 
the Autosar project. There are multiple parties interested in this 
as a way to demonstrate an automotive use case with some of the 
projects alongside the DPC++ compiler. This requires someone to lead 
this as a project, an initial meeting will be held to explore this.

Action: Rod to set up a meeting with relevant members to explore an 
Autosar demonstration project.

Foundation Goals and Metrics for 2024
-------------------------------------

A draft set of goals and metrics for the foundation in 2024 were 
presented by Rod Burns.

**Increase membership**
Metric: # of Steering, General and Contributor members

**Ensure open source projects operating effectively**
Metric: A health checklist for each project based on open source 
project best practices would be used

**Expand contributions to source code and specification**
Metrics: # of organisations contributing, total # of contributions 

**Increase community engagement**
Metrics: # of active users on Slack channels and mailing lists, 
# of attendees at SIG and Working Group meetings, # of individuals 
engaging on project RFCs

**Stand up foundation operations**
Metric: A health checklist for the foundation would be used

Comments from the committee:

* Would like to see something that measures the number of samples or 
  applications available for the UXL projects.
* To measure adoption we could track mentions/articles/applications
* Would like to track individual projects mentioned and used
* Can we track the number of supercomputers and clusters using the 
  UXL projects and DPC++?

Aim to share an updated version for offline discussion and approve 
at the next Steering Committee meeting for publication in full.

UXL Foundation Marketing Planning 2024
--------------------------------------

Alison Richards presented the marketing goals for 2024. 

At a high level these focus on:

* Building awareness of the foundation projects and activities 
  through events, papers and online activities
* Collaborating with key organisations, projects and communities 
  to expand the UXL Foundation community
* Getting the community to advocate and tell the world about the 
  UXL Foundation

Members of the Steering Committee were asked for their commitment to 
activities throughout the year including speaking and articles such 
as blog posts and case studies.

The Marketing Committee will define the plans for the year and share 
these with the Steering Committee for approval.

Agenda for next meeting
-----------------------

We were unable to discuss how we would go about the process of adding 
new projects to the foundation. This will be covered in the next 
meeting.

We also hope to approve the goals and metrics for the foundation.
