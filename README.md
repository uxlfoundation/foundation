 Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation
======================================

The Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation exists to define a 
standards-based, cross-architecture open specification for 
accelerated computing and to foster the open-source implementations 
of the specification.

More information can be found at http://www.uxlfoundation.org.

The community is invited to join the meetings, review the [oneAPI
Specification](https://spec.oneapi.io), and read the information 
in this repo. Contributions can be made by joining the Special 
Interest Groups (SIGs) or posting comments or questions as GitHub 
issues. General questions can go to this repo, and issues specific 
to parts of the specification can go to the 
[Specification repo](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneapi-spec).

The public calendar of UXL Foundation meetings is available using 
[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_4ac0186e0f9fc4e7243574437efd3e3383420e2318ce77aee1e0343706f5c936@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York).

Sign up to the mailing lists for the Working Groups and Special 
Interest Groups (SIGs) [here](https://lists.uxlfoundation.org/groups).

Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
------------------------------

SIGs host regular meetings to organize community proposals and
contributions to the oneAPI specification. They also act as a bridge
between the community and developers working on implementations of
the oneAPI specification.

* `Language` - This group covers topics related to
  language implementations that integrate with the oneAPI
  specification.

* `Math` - This groups covers topics related to math
  operations.

* `AI` - This group covers topics related to AI operations.

* `Hardware` - This group covers topics related to the
  integration of hardware and how this is defined in the oneAPI
  specification.

* `Safety Critical` - This group covers topics related to the
  use of UXL Foundation projects in safety critical applications.

The SIGS were previously running under the oneAPI Community 
Forum and previous meeting notes can be found on the [archived 
repository](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-tab).
