====================================
Image SIG - a oneAPI Community Forum
====================================

Introduction
============

The Image SIG hosts discussions and presentations for fundamental image
processing routines for high-performance computing, engineering, financial, and
other applications.

This SIG discusses the oneAPI Image Processing Library (oneIPL). Its goal is 
to become an extensive library of ready-to-use, highly optimized image 
processing functions. As part of UXL, oneIPL is designed to allow execution 
on various computational devices: CPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators. The 
functionality is subdivided into several domains: filers, geometry 
transformations, and color and type conversions.

Its royalty-free APIs help developers:

1. Use vectorization and SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) instructions
   on CPU and GPU.

2. Use CPU threading and GPU SIMT (single instruction, multiple threads).

3. Improve the performance of computation-intensive applications with pipelines
   involving image processing and other operations provided as DPC++ kernel or
   oneAPI libraries.

In addition to domain-specific functionality, the Image SIG may also discuss
overall design features like the execution model, memory model, or error
handling. At times, the open source oneIPL Interfaces project, which implements
the oneIPL specification may also be discussed.

Purpose of the Group
====================

The Image Special Interest Group (Image SIG) is committed to the collaborative
development, understanding, and promotion of the open standard oneIPL. We aim
to build a comprehensive image-processing library to set a new standard for
image processing in the oneAPI ecosystem.

1. Collaborate: Gather key industry stakeholders to contribute to the oneIPL
   standard. Engineers and software developers from across the industry will
   share insights, knowledge, and resources to collaboratively shape the future
   of the oneIPL specification.

2. Innovate: Encourage innovative thinking and problem-solving to advance the
   future of image processing within the oneAPI ecosystem.

3. Educate: Share experiences and best practices related to oneIPL with the
   wider oneAPI community.

Strategy for Achieving Goals
============================

To achieve these goals, the following strategic approach will be taken:

1. Community Building: Foster a vibrant and active community of engineers and
   software developers who meet regularly to discuss, debate, and determine the
   direction of oneIPL. This will be achieved through online events and a clear
   communication channel for group members.

2. Open Collaboration: Promote an open-source mindset to enable active
   contributions from all members. The group will focus on collaboration,
   maintaining a transparent process where all members have access to resources
   and are encouraged to provide input on development.

3. Training and Education: Organize training sessions, workshops, and webinars
   to educate members and the broader oneAPI ecosystem about the features,
   advantages, and potential of the oneIPL library. This will also be an
   opportunity to gather feedback and requirements from end users.

4. Regular Updates and Reviews: Schedule periodic meetings for group members to
   share their experiences, progress, and challenges with the oneIPL
   library. These sessions will act as a platform for knowledge sharing,
   brainstorming solutions, and shaping the roadmap for the future of the
   oneIPL specification.

5. Integration with the oneAPI Ecosystem: Work closely with the broader oneAPI
   community to ensure the oneIPL library seamlessly integrates with the other
   elements of the oneAPI ecosystem. This will help ensure the standard is
   accessible, beneficial, and valuable to the community.

Through this purpose and strategic approach, the Image Special Interest Group
will shape the future of image processing via the oneIPL image processing
library in alignment with the broader goals of the oneAPI ecosystem. We believe
in the power of collaborative innovation to drive the future of image
processing and look forward to contributing to this journey.
